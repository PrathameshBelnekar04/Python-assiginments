1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
Ans = While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file in it

2. What function is used to rename files??
Ans = os.rename() is the function used to rename.

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
Ans = the delete function permanantly deletes a file or a folder and send2trash will move the file or the folder to a recycle bin.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
Ans = Yes the zipfile.ZipFile() function is equivalent to the open() function with the first argument as the file name and 
the second argument as in which the mode the file will open in.

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
Ans = 

import os, shutil
def search_tree(folder, extensions, destFolder):
	folder = os.path.abspath(folder)
	destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
	for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
		for filename in filenames:
			name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
			if extension in extensions:
				fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
				print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
				shutil.copy(fileAbsPath, destFolder)

extensions = ['.php', '.py']
folder = 'Folder'
destFolder = 'destFolder'
search_tree(folder, extensions, destFolder)
