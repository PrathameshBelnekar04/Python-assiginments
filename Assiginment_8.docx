1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?
Ans = PyInputPlus is not a part of the python standard library, we must install it separately using pip

2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?
Ans = PyInputPlus is imported as pypi so that you can enter a shorter name when calling the module's functions

3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?
Ans = The inputInt() function returns an integer while the inputFloat() function returns a float value which is in decimal.

4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?
Ans = In the inputint function we can set the min = 0 and max =99 to ensure user enters number between 0 and 99

5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?
Ans = We can also use regular expressions to specify whether an input is allowed or not. The allowRegexes and blockRegexes
keyword arguments take a list of regular expression strings to determine what the PyInputPlus function will accept or reject as valid input.

6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?
Ans  = It will an exception RetryLimitException .

7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default=&#39;hello&#39;) do?
Ans = When you use limit keyword arguments and also pass a default keyword argument, the function returns the default value instead of raising an exception.
