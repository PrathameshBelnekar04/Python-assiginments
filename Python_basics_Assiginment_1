1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*  -> It is an expression
hello -> It is a value 
-87.8  It is a value 
-  -> It is an expression
/  -> It is an expression
+  -> It is an expression
6  -> It is a value 

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
strings are type of data which can be stored in a variable and are enclosed in quotes ex = "Hello world"
and variables are a type of named container to store string values ex = First_prg = "hello world" where First_prg is a container or variable to store string.


3. Describe three different data types.

Sequence type = example = String,list, Tuple
Numeric data type =  example = float,int,complex
Boolean =   example = Bool  Bool data type consists of True or false.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
expressions contain values which can be int,float,numbers, string ext
also can contain variables to strore data 
operators to perform mathematical operation which consists of arithmetic logical and comparision operators
expressions can -
assigin value to a variable 
can perform mathematical operation 
can compare  given values
perform logical operations
return or print data as a form of output.


5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
spam = 10 is a statement as it the value 10 is assigined to spam and  does not return a value 
an expression is a code which returns a value after evaluation on the other hand does not get evaluated for results

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
the variable bacon contains - bacon = 22

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
spam + spamspam 
spam * 3
if considered both are strings and both are enclosed in quotes the return value would be as follows
spam + spamspam - spamspamspam
spam * 3  - spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
eggs is considered as a variable because in python variable name should start with a letter.
in python variable names can start with a letter followed by letters or number or underscores
on the other hand 100 it starts from a number which is not accepted as a variable.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
1.str() it is used to convert a value to a string ex - str(10) will be converted to "10"
2. int() it is used to convert a value to integer ex - int(10.2) will be converted to 3
3. float() it is used to convert a value to float ex - float(10) will be convered to 10.0


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
I have eaten  + 99 +  burritos.
this expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, we cannot add  two diffrent data types in python we have to convert 99 from int to a str
fixed code - I have eaten  + str(99) +  burritos.
