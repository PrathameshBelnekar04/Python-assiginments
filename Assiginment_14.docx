1. What does RGBA stand for?
Ans = RGBA stands for Red-Green-Blue-Alpha.

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
Ans = from pillow module the ImageColor.getcolor() function so you don't have to memorize RGBA 
values for the colors you want to use. This function takes a color name string as its first argument
and the string 'RGBA' as its second argument, and it returns an RGBA tuple.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
Ans = 
A box.tuple is similar to a regular tuple in Python but with some additional features provided by the box library. 
pip install box
from box import Box
my_tuple = Box(1, 2, 3)  # Creating a box.tuple
You can access individual elements of a box.tuple using indexing, similar to regular tuples:
print(my_tuple[0])


4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an
Image object?
Ans = 
To find out the width and height of an Image object in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, 
you can utilize the PIL (Python Imaging Library)

from PIL import Image
import requests
from io import BytesIO

#Load the image from a URL or local file
url = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
response = requests.get(url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# Get the width and height of the image
width, height = image.size

# Print the width and height
print("Width:", width)
print("Height:", height)

5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left
quarter of it?
Ans = 
the crop() method is used to extract the desired portion of the image. The parameters (0, 50, 50, 100)
indicate the region to be cropped, where (left, upper, right, lower) represents the coordinates of the bounding box.
After cropping, you can optionally use the resize() method
to resize the cropped image to a specific size, such as 100x100 pixels.
Finally, you can choose to either display the resulting
cropped image using show() or save it to a file using save()

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
Ans = To save an updated or modified Image object as an image file using the PIL 
(Python Imaging Library) or its fork, Pillow,
you can use the save() method.

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
ans = 
Pillow's shape-drawing code is part of the ImageDraw module within the Pillow library
The ImageDraw module provides functionality for 
drawing shapes, lines, and text on an Image object.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind
of object?
Ans = Image objects in Pillow do not have built-in drawing methods
Instead, the drawing methods are provided by the ImageDraw object
which is obtained from the ImageDraw module

To get an ImageDraw object, you need to create it by calling the
ImageDraw.Draw() function and passing the Image object as an argument.
