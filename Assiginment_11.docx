1. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative
integer.
Ans = assert text >= 10, 'The text variable is a negetive variable.'


2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain
strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, &#39;hello&#39; and &#39;hello&#39; are
considered the same, and &#39;goodbye&#39; and &#39;GOODbye&#39; are also considered the same).
Ans= 
assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), 'The eggs and bacon variables are the same!' or assert eggs.upper() != bacon.upper(),
'The eggs and bacon variables are the same!'

3. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time.
Ans = asset False throws an AssertionError every time

4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?
Ans = import logging
logging.basicConfig()

5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a
logging message to a file named programLog.txt?
Ans = import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


6. What are the five levels of logging?
ans = DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL

7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?
Ans = logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)

8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?
ans = so that You can disable logging messages anytime you want without messing the code 
also you can  disable lower-level logging messages. 
You can create logging messages Logging messages also provides a timestamp.

9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?
ans = The Step button will move the debugger into a function call
The Over button will quickly execute the function call without stepping into it
The Out button will quickly execute the rest
of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in

10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?
ans = when you click on the contune it will continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.

11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?
ans = A breakpoint is a setting on a line of code that causes
the debugger to pause when the program execution reaches the line.
